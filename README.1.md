# Bootcamp-Homework-2
#
Notes:
# This is my first html/css project. It was very intensive work to be honest.  
#My goal was to get the frames of both homeworks tailored to your specification. I 
#think I did a pretty good job with both. Due to timne constrains, I did not finish #the portafolio pages in any of of the projects. I did complete the index and contact #pages in both jobs. With a bit more time I can complete the portafolio pages in the #near future.
